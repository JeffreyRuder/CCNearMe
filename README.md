# CC Near Me

#### By Jeffrey Ruder

## Description

The [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) is an effective website and a step forward in providing transparent information about colleges, but is has some issues related to community colleges specifically:

* Graduation rate information does not account for community college students who transfer to four-year institutions
* Many of the statistics related to average cost, average income outcomes, and so on aggregate students at community colleges and students at four year schools.

CC Near Me aims to highlight the most accurate and relevant parts of the College Scorecard Data set while adding geolocation functionality. Proximity plays a greater role in the college sections process for prospective community college students, so why not make use of the geolocation capabilities a phone provides?
